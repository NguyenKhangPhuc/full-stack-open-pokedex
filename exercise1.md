I will choose Javascript/TypeScript:
Question 1: The common setup steps for CI/CD is linting (keeping the code clean), testing (testing the all the current features of the project), and build (Put all of our current code to a runnable software bundle). The tool I will use for linting is eslint, for testing will be Jest, for building Typescript (tsc), for building Javascript (webpack or vite for react project).
Question 2: Besides Jenkins and Github Actions, there are many other tools to setup CI/CD: CircleCI, GitLab CI, Buildkite, TeamCity, Bamboo, Azure DevOps, Travis CI, and Drone CI.
Question 3: Talking about self-hosted and cloud-based environment, the decision will be depended on which kind of project are you developing and which one do you prefers. Let's say you project is between small and medium, then I will recommend you use cloud-based services for simplicity, for a larger project then you can use self-hosted environment like Jenkins. It's also depends on your hobby, if you want everything under your control but quite complicated with setup part you can choose Jenkins, or If you want the configuration part to be simpler, and everything is for "normal case" then you can choose cloud-based services.
